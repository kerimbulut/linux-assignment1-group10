1. What is the difference between the Linux kernel and the shell?
  The Linux kernel is the core part of the operating system that manages hardware, memory, 
  and processes. The shell is a command-line interface that allows users to interact with the
  kernel by typing commands. In short, the kernel does the work, while the shell acts as the
  bridge between the user and the kernel.

2. Explain the difference between an absolute path and a relative path with one example 
  of each.
 An absolute path shows the full location of a file or folder starting from the root directory
  /. For example: /home/student/docs/file.txt.
  A relative path shows the location in relation to the current working directory. 
  For example: if you are already inside /home/student/, then docs/file.txt is a relative path.
  3. The core components of Linux
 The core components of Linux are:

 Kernel: Controls hardware, processes, and system resources.

 Shell: Provides an interface for users to run commands.

 File System: Organizes and manages files and directories.

 System Utilities & Applications: Tools and programs that let users perform tasks such as 
 editing files, managing users, or networking.
